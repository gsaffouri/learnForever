# Terraform Simple Deployment

This project demonstrates a basic Terraform deployment to manage infrastructure as code. It deploys a simple Virtual Machine (VM) on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) using Terraform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

1. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (v1.0 or later)
2. A cloud provider account (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)
3. Cloud provider CLI (e.g., AWS CLI or Google Cloud SDK) installed and configured

### AWS Example:

- [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
